# List
- List is a collection of elements enclosed in a [].
- it can have different types of element.
- List is ordered. i.e [1,2,3,4,5] != [1,3,5,4,2]
- List element can be accessed using indexing. (0-based indexing)

lst = [12,3,24,54,34,33,22]
print(lst[0])

- list can be nested.
- list are mutable
- List are dynamic.

# Tuple
- Tuple is a collection of elements enclosed is a ()
- it can be a collection of element separated with ,

- empty tuple like this -
a = tuple()
for a single element tuple you have to give a comma otherwise it will treat that variable based on the type()
a = (2,) if we don't give , it will be treated as an integer

- Tuples are immutable
